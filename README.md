# Exploratory-Data-Analysis---Week-1

This project examines how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007 using the dataset from Electric Power 
Consumption. The task was to reconstruct example plots, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

1. Constructs the 4 different plots and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
2. Names each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
3. Creates a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R 
   constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced.
